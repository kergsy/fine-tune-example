But a team of scientists has discovered that it was actually a disease that was caused by an ancient disease that killed all animals for generations. The disease was called \"the black death\". It killed more than 60 million people in Europe in the 14th century. The disease was so deadly that it killed more people than all wars and plagues combined for more than a thousand years.\n"
